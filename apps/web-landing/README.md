# Wednesdays Main Website

### Content Strategy

To drive traffic to the signup/waiting list, I've created and structured the website based around keywords and items I would like to try to rank for. The following are the core pillar pages used for ranking:

1. Fun Golf Games
2. Golf Technology
3. Golf Tips
4. Social Golfing

These four categories are very intentional. They are the categories we will try to create content for in hopes of ranking on google while also staying aligned with the core idea behind the app itself.

### Notes

Interesting find: during keyword research, I found that the largest search volume was for "cheap golf courses near me". This means two things:

1. Proximity based searches are important
2. There is a market for average golfers not looking to spend to much

Based on these observations, it would be beneficial to add a useful feature for users on the site for finding golf courses. That would bring them back over time. Maybe even add a save and rating system, and tee time scheduling.
