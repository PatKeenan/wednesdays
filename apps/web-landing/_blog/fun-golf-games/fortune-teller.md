# Fortune Teller: The Psychic Golf Challenge That Tests Your Prediction Skills

Looking for a way to add some mystique and strategy to your golf game? Say hello to Fortune Teller, a thrilling [new golf game](https://wednesdays.golf/blog/fun-golf-games) that challenges players to tap into their inner psychic and predict their opponents' scores. This innovative game combines the skill of golf with the art of observation and prediction, creating an experience that's as mentally engaging as it is physically challenging.

## How to Play Fortune Teller

### Setting Up the Game

1. **Gather Your Group**: Fortune Teller works best with 3-4 players, but can be adapted for larger groups.
2. **Choose Your Holes**: Decide whether to play Fortune Teller for specific holes or for the entire round.
3. **Prepare Prediction Cards**: Each player should have a small notecard or a piece of paper for each hole being played.

### Playing the Game

1. **Make Your Predictions**: Before teeing off on each hole, players secretly write down their predictions for everyone else's scores on that hole. Don't forget to include your own prediction!

2. **Seal the Deal**: To prevent cheating, players must agree on a method to secure their predictions. This could involve:

   - Folding the papers and placing them in a sealed envelope
   - Using a trusted non-player as a "prediction keeper"
   - Utilizing a digital app that timestamps entries (hint: the Wednesdays Golf App might have some exciting features for this in the future!)

3. **Play the Hole**: Complete the hole as normal, keeping accurate stroke counts.

4. **The Big Reveal**: After everyone has finished the hole, gather to reveal the predictions and actual scores.

5. **Score the Predictions**: Players earn one point for each correct prediction of another player's score.

6. **Apply the Bonus**: Players can deduct one stroke from their actual score for that hole for each correct prediction they made.

### Scoring Example

Let's say we have four players: Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Dana. Here's how a hole might play out:

- Alice predicts: Bob (4), Charlie (5), Dana (4)
- Bob predicts: Alice (3), Charlie (4), Dana (5)
- Charlie predicts: Alice (4), Bob (4), Dana (4)
- Dana predicts: Alice (3), Bob (5), Charlie (5)

Actual scores: Alice (3), Bob (4), Charlie (5), Dana (4)

Results:

- Alice: 2 correct predictions, deducts 2 strokes
- Bob: 1 correct prediction, deducts 1 stroke
- Charlie: 2 correct predictions, deducts 2 strokes
- Dana: 3 correct predictions, deducts 3 strokes

## Why Fortune Teller is Perfect for Casual Golfers

1. **Levels the Playing Field**: Even if you're not the best golfer in your group, your observational skills and ability to read your friends might give you an edge.

2. **Adds Strategic Depth**: Players must consider not just their own game, but how their opponents might perform under pressure.

3. **Encourages Attentiveness**: To make accurate predictions, players need to pay close attention to their friends' playing styles and tendencies.

4. **Builds Camaraderie**: The game promotes friendly banter and discussion as players reveal their predictions and actual scores.

5. **Provides Comeback Opportunities**: A player having a rough day on the course might still excel at predictions, keeping them engaged and competitive.

## Tips for Mastering Fortune Teller

1. **Study Your Opponents**: Pay attention to how your friends typically perform on different types of holes.

2. **Consider the Conditions**: Factor in weather, course difficulty, and each player's current form when making predictions.

3. **Don't Overthink It**: Sometimes, going with your gut feeling can be more accurate than overanalyzing.

4. **Stay Consistent**: Try to maintain your usual pace and style of play to avoid giving away hints about your own performance.

5. **Practice Poker Face**: When writing down predictions, try not to give away any hints through your expressions or body language.
