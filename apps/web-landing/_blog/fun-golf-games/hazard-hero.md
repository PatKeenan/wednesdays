# Hazard Hero: The Golf Game That Turns Obstacles into Opportunities

Are you tired of fearing hazards on the golf course? Get ready to embrace them with Hazard Hero, an exciting new golf game that will transform the way you see sand traps, water hazards, and even cart paths. This innovative game is set to be a standout feature in the upcoming Wednesdays Golf App, launching in spring 2025. Let's dive into how Hazard Hero works and why it's about to become your new favorite way to play.

## How to Play Hazard Hero

Hazard Hero is designed to make golfers more comfortable around course hazards by turning them into point-scoring opportunities. Here's how it works:

1. **Objective**: Use hazards to your advantage and score points, but avoid getting stuck in them.
2. **Scoring**: Each hazard is worth a different number of points:
   - Water hazard: 3 points
   - Sand trap: 2 points
   - Cart path: 1 point
3. **Proximity Rule**: To score points, your ball must come within the group's shortest putter length of the hazard.
4. **One Hazard Per Hole**: You can only score points from one hazard on each hole, so choose wisely!
5. **The Catch**: If you get stuck in a hazard, you don't score any points for that hole.

## Strategy Tips for Hazard Hero

1. **Risk vs. Reward**: Assess each hole carefully. Sometimes, playing it safe might be better than risking a hazard.
2. **Know Your Strengths**: If you're great at sand shots, prioritize bunkers over water hazards.
3. **Course Management**: Use the game to improve your course management skills by thinking strategically about each shot.
4. **Practice Makes Perfect**: Use Hazard Hero as a fun way to practice those tricky shots you often avoid.

## Why Hazard Hero Will Transform Your Golf Game

1. **Builds Confidence**: By incentivizing play near hazards, you'll become more comfortable with these challenging areas.
2. **Improves Course Management**: You'll start seeing the course differently, considering risk and reward on every hole.
3. **Enhances Skills**: Regularly attempting shots near hazards will improve your overall game.
4. **Adds Excitement**: Turn a frustrating part of golf into an thrilling challenge!
