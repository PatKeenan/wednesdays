# Rando Scrambo: Adding a Dash of Chance to Your Scramble

Are you tired of the same old golf scramble format? Get ready for Rando Scrambo, a thrilling new twist on the classic game that's set to revolutionize your group golfing experience. Coming soon to the Wednesdays Golf App, this innovative game mode adds an element of chance that will keep you on your toes from tee to green.

## What is Rando Scrambo?

Rando Scrambo takes the traditional scramble format and gives it an unpredictable makeover. Here's how it works:

1. Players tee off as usual in a scramble format.
2. After the drives, instead of the team choosing the best shot, the Wednesdays Golf App randomly selects which ball the group will play next.
3. This process repeats for each shot until the ball is holed out.

The result? A dynamic, engaging game that levels the playing field and keeps everyone involved throughout the round.

## Why Rando Scrambo Rocks

1. **Equalizes the Game**: No more relying solely on your team's best player. Everyone's shot has the potential to be "the one."

2. **Increases Engagement**: With the possibility of any shot being chosen, players stay focused and give their all on every stroke.

3. **Adds Excitement**: The element of chance introduces a thrilling twist to each hole, keeping the energy high throughout the round.

4. **Improves Team Spirit**: Celebrate (or commiserate) together as the app reveals whose shot will be played next.

5. **Enhances Strategy**: Teams must consider different approaches, knowing that any shot could be selected.
